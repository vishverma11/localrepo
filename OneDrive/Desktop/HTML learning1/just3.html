    <h3> 3.2 Introduction to CSS</h3>
    <P> CSS is an abbreviation <strong>  for Cascading Style Sheets.</strong> CSS works with HTML and other Markup Languages<br>
    (such as XHTML and XML)to control the way the content is presented. Cascading Style Sheets is a means to<br>
separate the appearance of a webpage from the content of the webpage. CSS is the recommendation of the<br>
<strong>World Wide Web Consortium</strong>(the<strong>W3C)</strong></P>
<p> The concept of style sheet is very simple. First, the designer creats a standard Web page, using standard<br>
HTML tags. It is design so that it can be displayed properly in the browser that do not support style sheets.<br>
Now, suppose designer wants the <strong>heading</strong>(H1) should be display in <strong>red color</strong>and the <strong>paragraph </strong>(P)<br>
should be display in <strong>blue</strong>and <strong>Helvectica font.</strong>To accompish the, the author creats style rules that format<br>
the content on the web page in the manner that he or she chooses.</p>
<p>Style sheets would thus combine HTML tags (H1) with properties(such as color:red) to format each HTML<br>
tag. In the case of style sheets, an HTML tag is used as a selector. The property and value of the selector are<br>
combined into what is called <strong>declaration</strong>. Following are some example of style rules:</p>
<P><strong>
    H1 {colour: RED}<br>
    P {FONT-FAMILY: HELVECTICA; COLOUR:BLUE}
</strong></P>
<P>
    In the above stylesheet tag H1 and P is used as a selector and their properties such as colour and font-family is <br>
    used as a declaration part.
